I was cautious about ordering since there’s very little info or reviews around the internet, but it seems to be a very well made and reliable device. It’s totally fascinating to see my hormone levels on the chart! My LH levels don’t cooperate with standard ovulation strips (I never get a positive with standard strips), so it’s nice to see all the different hormones mapped out together.",
